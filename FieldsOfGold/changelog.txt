1.15.6-1.1.1
-Updated recipes for halved cattail root to ensure they function properly, and properly damage the tool
-Change mushroom growth times
-Added missing growth update for chick to pullet times

1.15.6-1.1.2/3
- Added ability to config hive harvest time

1.15.6-1.1.4
- Added fauna compatibility

1.15.7.-1.1.5
- Change how long animals are milkable after birth to match RL times. (Sheep -> 90 days, Aurochs -> 300 days)
- Fixed Bug where crops older than stage 1 and not at their ripe stage (varies, but often 8-9) would drop the crop block. (Note: They should only drop seeds at stage 1, or at full growth)

1.15.7.-1.1.6
- Corrected bug with cattail growth times. Were growing in just 4 hours.

1.15.7.-1.1.7
- Corrected bug resulting in growth times not affecting berries.

1.15.7-1.1.8
- Crops now give time until next stage, and adjust growth time based on server days per month and hours per day.\
- Massaged harvest numbers on grain downwards to 2-4 drops per harvest.  This number will continue to be dialed down in future changes.

1.16.4-1.1.9
- Removed hay recipe
- Implemented haystack
- Added interactions to get haybale and straw mat from haystack
- made Berrybush growth time reactive to month length
- Reduced grain drop to 2-3 per drop

1.16.4-1.1.10
- Fixed drop ratios so grains drop at least one crop.

1.16.4-1.1.11
- Fixed broken interaction with haybale.

1.16.4-1.1.12
- Fixed NPE crash with drygrass on certain interactions
- Correct More Crops crop drops.
- Add patch to make FOG compatible with More Classes.

(Upcoming Changes)
- Add configuration files for crop growth times
- Give berry bushes multiple stages of growth.
- Add planters pots, racks, and trays for pre-Spring planting.
- Add threshing mechanic to separate straw from grain
- Add wheat/rye/barley sheaves and flax stooks for drying grains
- Integrate mushroom logs for growing mushrooms 
  - Logs get placed in barrels with rot to produce 'mushroom log'.
  - Mushroom logs must be placed in shade, watered, and fertilized.
  - Mushrooms will gain a new growth stage during which they're sporing
  - Harvesting (certain) mushrooms during this time gets spores and mushrooms, others only spores.
  - Plant mushroom spores on log, will grow into mushrooms.

- Straw mats
	- Mats have different color shades based on their straw type
	- Add different variant mats by straw type (Flax, Grass, Rye, Spelt)

- Beds
	- Add beds for each variant type

- Pitchfork
	- Farmer weapon
	- Functionality? (Picking up and moving piles of straw w/o binding first?)

- Grass
	- Slow grass regrowth
	- Grass drop based on time of day, temperature, and climate
		- Wet grass when raining or first thing in the morning
		- fresh grass at all other times
	- Grass drying
		- Grass needs to be dried in a pile (haystack)
		- Base dry speed depends on
			-temperature
			-environment (degree of rainfall)
			-exposure to natural light
			-size of haystack
		- In haystacks with more than 64 hay, turning them occasionally is needed to facilitate drying
			-Alert will be added on block info that it needs to be turned
