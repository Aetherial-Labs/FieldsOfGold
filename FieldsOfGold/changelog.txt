  - Harvesting (certain) mushrooms during this time gets spores and mushrooms, others only spores.
  - Plant mushroom spores on log, will grow into mushrooms.
- Haystacks
	- Remove haystack recipe
	- Add haystacks as stackable items.
	- Hitting a full haystack with rope or cordage(PS) converts it to a haybale
- Add straw mats
